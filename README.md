# Exercise_with_LLM

This project generates coding challenges to help practicing programming languages (for now javascript and typescript).
It uses the Anthropic API (claude model) to create prompts focused on concepts of the specified programming language.
A prompt template defines criteria for the test understanding of a concept, provide some starter code.
The API response contains a code snippet for the challenge. This code is saved to an exercise file to be used for developer screening/testing.
