## Code Analysis

Analysis for the JavaScript exercise response:

 Here is my analysis of the JavaScript exercise:

Overall the code looks good! Here are a few notes:

Errors/Issues:
- No errors or major issues found. The code implements the function as described.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Add JSDoc comments to document the addNumbers function, its parameters, and return value. This helps explain how to use the function.

- Validate the input parameters are numbers before using them. Could add something like:

```js
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
  throw new Error('Parameters must be numbers');
}
```

Best Practices:
- Properly documenting functions with JSDoc makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

- Validating input data and throwing descriptive errors helps prevent bugs and issues down the line.

- Following a consistent code style and formatting convention improves readability. 

- Using descriptive variable and function names makes the code self-documenting.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to provide more details on JavaScript coding best practices.
